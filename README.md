# P.L.A.T.E. — Penetration, Lethality, Armor & Trauma Engine

A physics-driven overhaul of terminal ballistics, armor and trauma for SPT 4.0
(EFT 0.16.9.40087):

- **Penetration** — armor as a physical barrier: specific-energy thresholds
  anchored to real protection standards, material behavior (ceramic, steel,
  UHMWPE, aramid, titanium), hit angle, wear and local damage.
- **Lethality** — damage computed at the moment of impact from projectile
  physics and the actual path through the body; distance, barrel length,
  grazes, bones and vital zones all matter.
- **Armor interaction** — a penetrating bullet pays with energy, mass and
  shape; a blocked one delivers behind-armor blunt trauma.
- **Trauma** — blood volume as a separate resource: bleedings drain blood, not
  limb HP; blood-loss stages bring debuffs up to collapse and death; blood
  persists between raids, transfusions restore it.

Every model is anchored to published work rather than to hand-tuned game feel:
wound ballistics and ordnance-gelatin data for the wound channel, the Blunt
Criterion literature for behind-armor trauma, GOST protection classes for armor
thresholds, and the ATLS classification of hemorrhagic shock for the blood
system.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full list of changes vs vanilla and the
sources behind each model.

## Requirements

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| SPT | 4.0.13+ |
| EFT client | 0.16.9.40087 |

Both parts are required: the client plugin and the server mod work as a pair.

## Installation

- `PLATE.Client.dll` → `<SPT>\BepInEx\plugins\PLATE\`
- `PLATE.Server.dll` (+ `bundles/`) → `<SPT>\SPT\user\mods\PLATE\`

Server config (`config.jsonc`) and the ammo reference book
(`ammo-reference.jsonc`) are generated next to the server dll on first start.
Client gameplay settings live in the F12 menu; fine-tuning constants that are
hidden there can be edited in `BepInEx\config\com.anamelash.plate.cfg`.

## Building from source

Requires .NET SDK 9. Set your game path in `Directory.Build.props`
(`SptGameDir`), then:

```bash
pwsh -File build/deploy.ps1
```

The script builds both projects (Release) and copies them into the game
installation. Close the game and the SPT server before deploying.

## Troubleshooting

- Server side: look for `[PLATE]` lines in `user/logs/spt/spt<date>.log`.
- Client side: `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` contains a patch-target self-test; a
  FAIL there usually means an SPT update changed remapped class names.
- `BepInEx/plugins/PLATE/events.log` records every hit with its physical
  breakdown — please attach it to bug reports.
